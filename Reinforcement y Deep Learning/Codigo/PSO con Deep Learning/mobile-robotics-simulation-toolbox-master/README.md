## About the Toolbox

This toolbox provides utilities for robot simulation and algorithm development. 

This includes:
* 2D kinematic models for robot geometries such as differential drive, three, and four-wheeled vehicles, including forward and inverse kinematics
* Configurable lidar and object detector simulators 
* Visualization of robotic vehicles and sensors in occupancy grid maps
* MATLAB and Simulink examples and documentation

## Getting Started

Download the toolbox either by cloning this repository or downloading as a ZIP file. 
In MATLAB, navigate to the folder containing the toolbox and run the 
`startMobileRoboticsSimulationToolbox.m` script.

Alternatively, you can download the MATLAB toolbox file from the "Releases" section. 
You can install the toolbox file directly to MATLAB.

Regardless of how you install it, refer to the `GettingStarted.mlx` 
Live Script included to learn more about this toolbox.
