abstract = {A very simple particle swarm optimization iterative algorithm is presented, with just one equation and one social/confidence parameter. We define a «no-hope» convergence criterion and a «rehope» method so that, from time to time, the swarm re-initializes its position, according to some gradient estimations of the objective function and to the previous re-initialization (it means it has a kind of very rudimentary memory). We then study two different cases, a quite «easy» one (the Alpine function) and a «difficult» one (the Banana function), but both just in dimension two. The process is improved by taking into account the swarm gravity center (the «queen») and the results are good enough so that it is certainly worthwhile trying the method on more complex problems. {\textcopyright} 1999 IEEE.},

@article{Chowdhury2013,
abstract = {Engineering design problems often involve non-linear criterion functions, including inequality and equality constraints, and a mixture of discrete and continuous design variables. Optimization approaches entail substantial challenges when solving such an all-inclusive design problem. In this paper, a modification of the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm is presented, which can adequately address system constraints while dealing with mixed-discrete variables. Continuous search (particle motion), as in conventional PSO, is implemented as the primary search strategy; subsequently, the discrete variables are updated using a deterministic nearest-feasible-vertex criterion. This approach is expected to alleviate the undesirable difference in the rates of evolution of discrete and continuous variables. The premature stagnation of candidate solutions (particles) due to loss of diversity is known to be one of the primary drawbacks of the basic PSO dynamics. To address this issue in high dimensional design problems, a new adaptive diversity-preservation technique is developed. This technique characterizes the population diversity at each iteration. The estimated diversity measure is then used to apply (i) a dynamic repulsion away from the best global solution in the case of continuous variables, and (ii) a stochastic update of the discrete variables. For performance validation, the Mixed-Discrete PSO algorithm is applied to a wide variety of standard test problems: (i) a set of 9 unconstrained problems, and (ii) a comprehensive set of 98 Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) problems. We also explore the applicability of this algorithm to a large scale engineering design problem - -wind farm layout optimization. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {Inertia weight is one of the most important parameters of particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. Based on the basic idea of decreasing inertia weight (DIW), two strategies of natural exponential functions were proposed. Four different benchmark functions were used to evaluate the effects of these strategies on the PSO performance. The results of the experiments show that these two new strategies converge faster than linear one during the early stage of the search process. For most continuous optimization problems, these two strategies perform better than the linear one.},

abstract = {Although recent progress in 2D mobile robot navigation has been significant, the great majority of existing work focuses only on ensuring that the robot reaches its goal. But to make autonomous navigation truly successful, the 'quality' of planned motion is important as well. Here, we develop and analyze a pose-following kinematic control law applicable to unicycle-type robots, such that the robot can generate intuitive, fast, smooth, and comfortable trajectories. The Lyapunov-based feedback control law is derived via singular perturbation. It is made up of three components: (i) egocentric polar coordinates with respect to an observer on the vehicle, (ii) a slow subsystem which describes the position of the vehicle, where the reference heading is obtained via state feedback, and (iii) a fast subsystem which describes the steering of the vehicle, where the vehicle heading is exponentially stabilized to the obtained reference heading. The resulting path is a smooth and intuitive curve, globally converging to an arbitrary target pose without singularities, from any given initial pose. Furthermore, we present a simple path following strategy based on the proposed control law to satisfy arbitrary velocity, acceleration and jerk bounds imposed by the user. Such requirements are important to any autonomous vehicle so as to avoid actuator overload and to make the path physically realizable, and they are critical for applications like autonomous wheelchairs where passengers can be physically fragile. {\textcopyright} 2011 IEEE.},

@article{Couceiro2012,
abstract = {One of the most well-known bio-inspired algorithms used in optimization problems is the particle swarm optimization (PSO), which basically consists on a machine-learning technique loosely inspired by birds flocking in search of food. More specifically, it consists of a number of particles that collectively move on the search space in search of the global optimum. The Darwinian particle swarm optimization (DPSO) is an evolutionary algorithm that extends the PSO using natural selection, or survival of the fittest, to enhance the ability to escape from local optima. This paper firstly presents a survey on PSO algorithms mainly focusing on the DPSO. Afterward, a method for controlling the convergence rate of the DPSO using fractional calculus (FC) concepts is proposed. The fractional-order optimization algorithm, denoted as FO-DPSO, is tested using several well-known functions, and the relationship between the fractional-order velocity and the convergence of the algorithm is observed. Moreover, experimental results show that the FO-DPSO significantly outperforms the previously presented FO-PSO. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer-Verlag London Limited.},

It turns out that some of them are not very useful as challenging test functions, since they neither allow for a discrimination between different variants of genetic operators nor exhibit a dimensionality scaling resembling that of real-world problems, for example that of global structure optimization of atomic and molecular clusters. The latter properties seem to be simulated better by two other types of benchmark functions. One type is designed to be deceptive, exemplified here by Lunacek's function. The other type offers additional advantages of markedly increased complexity and of broad tunability in search space characteristics. For the latter type, we use an implementation based on randomly distributed Gaussians. We advocate the use of the latter types of test functions for algorithm development and benchmarking.},

abstract = {The general purpose optimization method known as Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) has received much attention in past years, with many attempts to find the variant that performs best on a wide variety of optimization problems. The focus of past research has been with making the PSO method more complex, as this is frequently believed to increase its adaptability to other optimization problems. This study takes the opposite approach and simplifies the PSO method. To compare the efficacy of the original PSO and the simplified variant here, an easy technique is presented for efficiently tuning their behavioural parameters. The technique works by employing an overlaid meta-optimizer, which is capable of simultaneously tuning parameters with regard to multiple optimization problems, whereas previous approaches to meta-optimization have tuned behavioural parameters to work well on just a single optimization problem. It is then found that not only the PSO method and its simplified variant have comparable performance for optimizing a number of Artificial Neural Network problems, but also the simplified variant appears to offer a small improvement in some cases. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {We consider the basic challenge of drawing a smooth curve through a list of ordered points in a plane. This is similar to the kids' game known as "join-the-dots", which usually results in some kind of shape. Requiring that not only the curve but also its slope is continuous at each point gives rise to a well-defined mathematical optimization problem. In order to address it we make use of co-called "Smooth Connection Function" (SCF), which provide generic solutions to Hermite's interpolation between two points in two dimensions. We have shown previously that SCFs can be determined analytically as the exact solutions of a variational problem that is invariant under translations and rotations (J. Phys. A: Math. Gen. 35 (2002) 3877). A SCF has a unique solution, given its boundary points and slopes, and only depends on a single parameter determining the relative importance of minimal curvature with respect to minimal length. The extreme examples are a very large , requiring minimal curvature at each point and therefore giving rise to curves made only of circle segments, and a vanishing optimizing only total length and thus resulting in straight lines. Here we show that the curve connecting all points can be constructed from SCF segments and that the slope at each point arises naturally when optimizing overall smoothness. Our approach provides a practical, yet rigorous, solution to the very general challenge of defining shapes from a collection of points.},

This paper proposed a new methodology to determine the optimize trajectory of the path for multi-robots in clutter environment using hybridization of improving classical Q-learning based on four fundamental principles with improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO) by modifying parameters and differentially perturbed velocity (DV) algorithm for improving the convergence. The algorithms are used to minimize path length and arrival time of all the robots to their respective destination in the environment and reducing the turning angle of each robot to reduce the energy consumption of each robot. In this proposed scheme, the improve classical Q-learning stores the Q-value of the best action of the state and thus save the storage space, which is used to decide the Pbest and gbest of the improved PSO in each iteration, and the velocity of the IPSO is adjusted by the vector differential operator inherited from differential evolution (DE). The validation of the algorithm is studied in simulated and Khepera-II robot.},

In particular this required the development of a training procedure, a set of actions available to the robot, a suitable state representation and a reward function. The setup was evaluated using a simulated real-time environment. A reference setup, different goal-oriented exploration strategies and two different robot kinematics (holonomic, differential) were compared in the evaluation. In a challenging scenario with obstacles at changing locations in the environment the robot was able to reach the desired goal in 93{\%} of the episodes.},

abstract = {Optimization problems often require the use of optimization methods that permit the minimization or maximization of certain objective functions. Occasionally, the problems that must be optimized are not linear or polynomial; they cannot be precisely resolved, and they must be approximated. In these cases, it is necessary to apply heuristics, which are able to resolve these kinds of problems. Some algorithms linearize the restrictions and objective functions at a specific point of the space by applying derivatives and partial derivatives for some cases, while in other cases evolutionary algorithms are used to approximate the solution. This work proposes the use of artificial neural networks to approximate the objective function in optimization problems to make it possible to apply other techniques to resolve the problem. The objective function is approximated by a non-linear regression that can be used to resolve an optimization problem. The derivate of the new objective function should be polynomial so that the solution of the optimization problem can be calculated.},

However, as one key issue in robot navigation, how to plan an optimal rescue path of a robot has not yet been fully solved. This paper studies robot path planning for multisurvivor rescue in limited survival time using a representative heuristic, particle swarm optimization (PSO). First, the robot path planning problem including multiple survivors is formulated as a discrete optimization one with high constraint, where the number of rescued persons is taken as the unique objective function, and the strength of a trapped person is used to constrain the feasibility of a path. Then, a new integer PSO algorithm is presented to solve the mathematical model, and several new operations, such as the update of a particle, the insertion and inversion operators, and the rapidly local search method, are incorporated into the proposed algorithm to improve its effectiveness. Finally, the simulation results demonstrate the capacity of our method in generating optimal paths with high quality.},

A potential function based on superquadrics is presented, which closely models a large class of object shapes. This potential function also prevents the creation of local minima when it is added to spherically symmetric attractive wells. Two compatible forms of the superquadric potential function are introduced: one for obstacle avoidance, and another for obstacle approach. The avoidance and approach potentials are implemented in simulations. In these simulations the end effector of the manipulator experiences an attractive force from a global spherical well, while the end effector and each of the links experience repulsive forces from all of the objects. The authors have also experimentally implemented the avoidance potentials on the CMU DDARM II. The results demonstrate successful obstacle avoidance and approach, and exhibit an improvement over existing potential schemes. {\textcopyright} 1990 IEEE},

In this scheme, multiple agents in a swarm self-organize to flock and achieve formation control through attractive and repulsive forces among themselves using APFs. In particular, this paper presents a set of analytical guidelines for designing potential functions to avoid local minima for a number of representative scenarios. Specifically the following cases are addressed: 1) A non-reachable goal problem (a case that the potential of the goal is overwhelmed by the potential of an obstacle, 2) an obstacle collision problem (a case that the potential of the obstacle is overwhelmed by the potential of the goal), 3) an obstacle collision problem in swarm (a case that the potential of the obstacle is overwhelmed by potential of other robots in a group formation) and 4) an inter-robot collision problem (a case that the potential of the robot in a formation is overwhelmed by potential of the goal). The simulation results showed that the proposed scheme can effectively construct a self-organized swarm system with the capability of group formation, navigation and migration in the presence of obstacles. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2006.},

These properties make swarm intelligence a successful design paradigm for algorithms that deal with increasingly complex problems. In this chapter we focus on two of the most successful examples of op- timization techniques inspired by swarm intelligence: ant colony optimization and particle swarm optimization. Ant colony optimization was introduced as a technique for combinatorial optimization in the early 1990s. The inspiring source of ant colony optimization is the foraging behavior of real ant colonies.

Six most commonly used benchmarks are used to evaluate the MLDW strategies on the performance of PSOs. The results suggest that the PSO with W5 strategy is a good choice for solving unimodal problems due to its fast convergence speed, and the CLPSO with W5 strategy is more suitable for solving multimodal problems.

abstract = {An important factor contributing to the success of particle swarm optimization (PSO) is the balance between exploration and exploitation of the swarm. Exploration is typically preferred at the initial stages of the search but is required to gradually give way to exploitation of promising solutions as the search progresses. The diversity of a particle swarm optimization algorithm can be defined, simply, as the degree of dispersion of the particles in the swarm. This dispersion could be defined around some center-point or not. It could also be defined based on the positions of the particles or on their velocities. This paper takes a look at some of the different definitions of swarm diversity with the intention of determining their usefulness in quantifying swarm exploration/exploitation. This work is intended to lay the foundations for the development of a suitable means to quantify the rate of change from exploration to exploitation of a PSO, i.e. the rate of change of diversity. {\textcopyright} 2008 IEEE.},

abstract = {A hybrid path planning algorithm based on membrane pseudo-bacterial potential field (MemPBPF) is proposed. Membrane-inspired algorithms can reach an evolutionary behavior based on biochemical processes to find the best parameters for generating a feasible and safe path. The proposed MemPBPF algorithm uses a combination of the structure and rules of membrane computing. In that sense, the proposed MemPBPF algorithm contains dynamic membranes that include a pseudo-bacterial genetic algorithm for evolving the required parameters in the artificial potential field method. This hybridization between membrane computing, the pseudo-bacterial genetic algorithm, and the artificial potential field method provides an outperforming path planning algorithm for autonomous mobile robots. Computer simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MemPBPF algorithm in terms of path length considering collision avoidance and smoothness. Comparisons with two different versions employing a different number of elementary membranes and with other artificial potential field based algorithms are presented. The proposed MemPBPF algorithm yields improved performance in terms of time execution by using a parallel implementation on a multi-core computer. Therefore, the MemPBPF algorithm achieves high performance yielding competitive results for autonomous mobile robot navigation in complex and real scenarios.},

These cameras move independently and can be mounted on different platforms. All cameras work together to build a global map, including 3D positions of static background points and trajectories of moving foreground points. We introduce intercamera pose estimation and intercamera mapping to deal with dynamic objects in the localization and mapping process. To further enhance the system robustness, we maintain the position uncertainty of each map point. To facilitate intercamera operations, we cluster cameras into groups according to their view overlap, and manage the split and merge of camera groups in real time. Experimental results demonstrate that our system can work robustly in highly dynamic environments and produce more accurate results in static environments. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {The particle swarm is an algorithm for finding op- timal regions of complex search spaces through the interaction of individuals in a population ofparticles. Even though the algorithm, which is based on a metaphor of social interaction, has been shown to perform well, researchers have not adequately explained how it works. Further, traditional versions of the algorithm have had some undesirable dynamical properties, notably the particles' ve- locities needed to be limited in order to control their trajectories. The present paper analyzes a particle's trajectory as it moves in discrete time (the algebraic view), then progresses to the view of it in continuous time (the analytical view). A five-dimensional de- piction is developed, which describes the system completely. These analyses lead to a generalized model of the algorithm, containing a set of coefficients to control the system's convergence tendencies. Some results of the particle swarm optimizer, implementing modi- fications derived fromthe analysis, suggest methods for altering the original algorithm in ways that eliminate problems and increase the ability ofthe particle swarm to find optima ofsome well-studied test functions.},

abstract = {Swarm intelligence, and swarm robotics in particular, are reaching a point where leveraging the potential of communication within an artificial system promises to uncover new and varied directions for interesting research without compromising the key properties of swarm-intelligent systems such as self-organization, scalability, and robustness. However, the physical constraints of using radios in a robotic swarm are hardly obvious, and the intuitive models often used for describing such systems do not always capture them with adequate accuracy. In order to demonstrate this effectively in the classroom, certain tools can be used, including simulation and real robots. Most instructors currently focus on simulation, as it requires significantly less investment of time, money, and maintenance-but to really understand the differences between simulation and reality, it is also necessary to work with the real platforms from time to time. To our knowledge, our course may be the only one in the world where individual students are consistently afforded the opportunity to work with a networked multi-robot system on a tabletop. The e-Puck, a low-cost small-scale mobile robotic platform designed for educational use, allows us bringing real robotic hardware into the classroom in numbers sufficient to demonstrate and teach swarm-robotic concepts. We present here a custom module for local radio communication as a stackable extension board for the e-Puck, enabling information exchange between robots and also with any other IEEE 802.15.4-compatible devices. Transmission power can be modified in software to yield effective communication ranges as small as fifteen centimeters. This intentionally small range allows us to demonstrate interesting collective behavior based on local information and control in a limited amount of physical space, where ordinary radios would typically result in a completely connected network. Here we show the use of this module facilitating a collective decision among a group of 10 robots. ?? Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.},

The cooperation between robots requires multiple factors that need to be taken into consideration such as communication between agents, distributed control, power autonomy, cooperation, navigation strategy, locomotion, among others. This work focuses on navigation strategy with obstacles avoidance and victims localization. The strategy used for navigation is based on swarm theory where each robot is an swarm agent. The calculation of attraction and repulsion forces used to keep the swarm compact is used to avoid obstacles and attract the swarm to the victim zones. Additionally, an agent separation behavior is added, so the swarm can leave behind the agents, who found victims so these can support the victims by transmitting their location to a rescue team. Several experiments were performed to test navigation, obstacle avoidance and victims search. The results show how the swarm theory meets the requirements of navigation and search operations of cooperative robots.},

abstract = {This paper presents a unique real-time obstacle avoidance approach for manipulators and mobile robots based on the artificial potential field concept. Collision avoidance, tradi- tionally considered a high level planning problem, can be effectively distributed between different levels of control, al- lowing real-time robot operations in a complex environment. This method has been extended to moving obstacles by using a time-varying artificial potential field. We have applied this obstacle avoidance scheme to robot arm mechanisms and have used a new approach to the general problem of real-time manipulator control. We reformulated the manipulator con- trol problem as direct control of manipulator motion in oper- ational space-the space in which the task is originally described-rather than as control of the task's corresponding joint space motion obtained only after geometric and kine- matic transformation. Outside the obstacles' regions of influ- ence, we caused the end effector to move in a straight line with an upper speed limit. The artificial potential field ap- proach has been extended to collision avoidance for all ma- nipulator links. In addition, ajoint space artificial potential field is used to satisfy the manipulator internal joint con- straints. This method has been implemented in the COSMOS system for a PUMA 560 robot. Real-time collision avoidance demonstrations on moving obstacles have been performed by using visual sensing. 1.},

The QPSO that was originally developed for continuous search spaces outperforms the traditional PSO in search ability. This paper analyzes the main factors that impact the search ability of QPSO and converts the particle movement formula to the mutation condition by introducing the rejection region, thus proposing a new binary algorithm, named swarm optimization genetic algorithm (SOGA), because it is more like genetic algorithm (GA) than PSO in form. SOGA has crossover and mutation operator as GA but does not need to set the crossover and mutation probability, so it has fewer parameters to control. The proposed algorithm was tested with several nonlinear high-dimension functions in the binary search space, and the results were compared with those from BPSO, BQPSO, and GA. The experimental results show that SOGA is distinctly superior to the other three algorithms in terms of solution accuracy and convergence.},

abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems are one of the most rapidly developing, highest level and most practical applied unmanned aerial systems. Collision avoidance and trajectory planning are the core areas of any UAV system. However, there are theoretical and practical problems associated with the existing methods. To manage these problems, this paper presents an optimized artificial potential field (APF) algorithm for multi-UAV operation in 3-D dynamic space. The classic APF algorithm is restricted to single UAV trajectory planning and usually fails to guarantee the avoidance of collisions. To overcome this challenge, a method is proposed with a distance factor and jump strategy to solve common problems, such as unreachable targets, and ensure that the UAV will not collide with any obstacles. The method considers the UAV companions as dynamic obstacles to realize collaborative trajectory planning. Furthermore, the jitter problem is solved using the dynamic step adjustment method. Several resolution scenarios are illustrated. The method has been validated in quantitative test simulation models and satisfactory results were obtained in a simulated urban environment.},

abstract = {Particle swarm optimisation (PSO) is a general purpose optimisation algorithm used to address hard optimisation problems. The algorithm operates as a result of a number of particles converging on what is hoped to be the best solution. How the particles move through the problem space is therefore critical to the success of the algorithm. This study utilises meta optimisation to compare a number of velocity update equations to determine which features of each are of benefit to the algorithm. A number of hybrid velocity update equations are proposed based on other high performing velocity update equations. This research also presents a novel application of PSO to train a neural network function approximator to address the watershed management problem. It is found that the standard PSO with a linearly changing inertia, the proposed hybrid Attractive Repulsive PSO with avoidance of worst locations (AR PSOAWL) and Adaptive Velocity PSO (AV PSO) provide the best performance overall. The results presented in this paper also reveal that commonly used PSO parameters do not provide the best performance. Increasing and negative inertia values were found to perform better.},

This paper presents a new PSO model, called PSO with composite particles (PSO-CP), to address dynamic optimization problems. PSO-CP partitions the swarm into a set of composite particles based on their similarity using a "worst first" principle. Inspired by the composite particle phenomenon in physics, the elementary members in each composite particle interact via a velocity-anisotropic reflection scheme to integrate valuable information for effectively and rapidly finding the promising optima in the search space. Each composite particle maintains the diversity by a scattering operator. In addition, an integral movement strategy is introduced to promote the swarm diversity. Experiments on a typical dynamic test benchmark problem provide a guideline for setting the involved parameters and show that PSO-CP is efficient in comparison with several state-of-the-art PSO algorithms for dynamic optimization problems.},

To simulate selection, many simultaneous, parallel PSO algorithms, each one a swarm, operate on a test problem. Simple rules are developed to implement selection. The ability of this so-called Darwinian PSO to escape local optima is evaluated by comparing a single swarm and a similar set of swarms, differing primarily in the absence of the selection mechanism, operating on the same test problem. The selection process is shown to be capable of evolving the best type of particle velocity control, which is a problem specific design choice of the PSO algorithm.

In other words it might alternate between "good" moves and "bad" moves in such a way that the algorithm wins every game. Thus it would seem that the algorithm would not learn a min/max playing strategy. Exercise 1.2 (Symmetries): We could improve our reinforcement learning algorithm by taking advantage of symmetry by simplifying the definition of the "state" and "action" upon which the algorithm would works. By simplifying the state in such a way that the dimension decreases we can be more confident that our learned results will be statistically significant since the state space we operate in is reduced. If our opponent was taking advantage of symmetries in the game tic-tac-toe our algorithm should also since this fact, would enable us to be a better game player against this type of player. If our player does not use symmetries then our algorithm should not either (except to reduce the state space as discussed above) since enforcing a symmetry on our opponent (that is not in fact there) should decrease our performance when playing against this type of opponent.},

It introduces a new fitness function divided into sub-functions, where each sub-function is responsible for accomplishing given objectives and imposed constraints. The main objectives of proposed sub-functions are to maximize the distance between the robot and a previously detected nearest obstacle, minimize distance from the robot to a global best position of the particles and the local minima problem avoidance. Also, proper constraints are included to prevent the robot from penetrating into restricted (prohibited) areas around detected obstacles or to avoid that particle moves too far away from the mobile robot's current position. The proposed PSO based planner generates a smooth collision free path with a low computational cost and approaches the goal position employing an adaptive control strategy. The adjustment and selection of suitable parameters values of PSO method are based on extensive simulations performed in various environments. The effectiveness of the proposed method has been verified with a series of simulations.},

abstract = {Recently, deep reinforcement learning (RL) methods have been applied successfully to multi-agent scenarios. Typically, the observation vector for decentralized decision making is represented by a concatenation of the (local) information an agent gathers about other agents. However, concatenation scales poorly to swarm systems with a large number of homogeneous agents as it does not exploit the fundamental properties inherent to these systems: (i) the agents in the swarm are interchangeable and (ii) the exact number of agents in the swarm is irrelevant. Therefore, we propose a new state representation for deep multi-agent RL based on mean embeddings of distributions, where we treat the agents as samples and use the empirical mean embedding as input for a decentralized policy. We define different feature spaces of the mean embedding using histograms, radial basis functions and neural networks trained end-to-end. We evaluate the representation on two well-known problems from the swarm literature-rendezvous and pursuit evasion-in a globally and locally observable setup. For the local setup we furthermore introduce simple communication protocols. Of all approaches, the mean embedding representation using neural network features enables the richest information exchange between neighboring agents, facilitating the development of complex collective strategies.},

The simulated flock is an elaboration of a particle system, with the simulated birds being the particles. The aggregate motion of the simulated flock is created by a distributed behavioral model much like that at work in a natural flock; the birds choose their own course. Each simulated bird is implemented as an independent actor that navigates according to its local perception of the dynamic environment, the laws of simulated physics that rule its motion, and a set of behaviors programmed into it by the "animator." The aggregate motion of the simulated flock is the result of the dense interaction of the relatively simple behaviors of the individual simulated birds.},

abstract = {This paper describes the use of cubic splines for interpolating monotonic data sets. Interpolating cubic splines are popular for fitting data because they use low-order polynomials and have C2 continuity, a property that permits them to satisfy a desirable smoothness constraint. Unfortunately, that same constraint often violates another desirable property: monotonicity. It is possible for a set of monotonically increasing (or decreasing) data points to yield a curve that is not monotonic, i.e., the spline may oscillate. In such cases, it is necessary to sacrifice some smoothness in order to preserve monotonicity. The goal of this work is to determine the smoothest possible curve that passes through its control points while simultaneously satisfying the monotonicity constraint. We first describe a set of conditions that form the basis of the monotonic cubic spline interpolation algorithm presented in this paper. The conditions are simplified and consolidated to yield a fast method for determining monotonicity. This result is applied within an energy minimization framework to yield linear and nonlinear optimization-based methods. We consider various energy measures for the optimization objective functions. Comparisons among the different techniques are given, and superior monotonic C2 cubic spline interpolation results are presented. Extensions to shape preserving splines and data smoothing are described. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Learning to act in a multiagent environment is a difficult problem since the normal definition of an optimal policy no longer applies. The optimal policy at any moment depends on the policies of the other agents. This creates a situation of learning a moving target. Previous learning algorithms have one of two shortcomings depending on their approach. They either converge to a policy that may not be optimal against the specific opponents' policies, or they may not converge at all. In this article we examine this learning problem in the framework of stochastic games. We look at a number of previous learning algorithms showing how they fail at one of the above criteria. We then contribute a new reinforcement learning technique using a variable learning rate to overcome these shortcomings. Specifically, we introduce the WoLF principle, "Win or Learn Fast", for varying the learning rate. We examine this technique theoretically, proving convergence in self-play on a restricted class of iterated matrix games. We also present empirical results on a variety of more general stochastic games, in situations of self-play and otherwise, demonstrating the wide applicability of this method. {\textcopyright} 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.},

Meanwhile, the main pull factor that attracts long- haul travel by international tourists to Penang was its ‘culture and history'. Additionally, there were partly direct and significant relationships between socio-demographic, trip characteristics and travel motivation (push factors and pull factors). Overall, this study identified the long-haul travel motivations by international tourists to Penang based on socio-demographic, trip characteristics and travel motivation and has indirectly helped in understanding the long-haul travel market particularly for Penang and Southeast Asia.

Experimental results show that the proposed SQL-SIE is more efficient than SQL as measured by the time taken by the swarm to complete this part of the mission.

Through a systematic evaluation by the students, we show that the e- puck fits this purpose and is appreciated by 90 percent of a large sample of students.},

abstract = {Background: Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is an established method for parameter optimization. It represents a population-based adaptive optimization technique that is influenced by several "strategy parameters". Choosing reasonable parameter values for the PSO is crucial for its convergence behavior, and depends on the optimization task. We present a method for parameter meta-optimization based on PSO and its application to neural network training. The concept of the Optimized Particle Swarm Optimization (OPSO) is to optimize the free parameters of the PSO by having swarms within a swarm. We assessed the performance of the OPSO method on a set of five artificial fitness functions and compared it to the performance of two popular PSO implementations. Results: Our results indicate that PSO performance can be improved if meta-optimized parameter sets are applied. In addition, we could improve optimization speed and quality on the other PSO methods in the majority of our experiments. We applied the OPSO method to neural network training with the aim to build a quantitative model for predicting blood-brain barrier permeation of small organic molecules. On average, training time decreased by a factor of four and two in comparison to the other PSO methods, respectively. By applying the OPSO method, a prediction model showing good correlation with training-, test- and validation data was obtained. Conclusion: Optimizing the free parameters of the PSO method can result in performance gain. The OPSO approach yields parameter combinations improving overall optimization performance. Its conceptual simplicity makes implementing the method a straightforward task. {\textcopyright} 2006Meissner et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {Modern optimisation algorithms are often metaheuristic, and they are very promising in solving NP-hard optimisation problems. In this paper, we show how to use the recently developed firefly algorithm to solve non-linear design problems. For the standard pressure vessel design optimisation, the optimal solution found by FA is far better than the best solution obtained previously in the literature. In addition, we also propose a few new test functions with either singularity or stochastic components but with known global optimality and thus they can be used to validate new optimisation algorithms. Possible topics for further research are also discussed. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2010 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

@article{Rimon1992,
abstract = {We present a new methodology for exact robot motion planning and control that unifies the purely kinematic path planning problem with the lower level feedback controller design. Complete information about the freespace and goal is encoded in the form of a special artificial potential function—a navigation function—that connects the kinematic planning problem with the dynamic execution problem in a provably correct fashion. The navigation function automatically gives rise to a bounded-torque feedback controller for the robot's actuators that guarantees collision-free motion and convergence to the destination from almost all intial free configurations. Since navigation functions exist for any robot and obstacle course, our methodology is completely general in principle. However, this paper is mainly concerned with certain constructive techniques for a particular class of motion planning problems. Specifically, we present a formula for navigation functions that guide a point-mass robot in a generalized sphere world. The simplest member of this family is a space obtained by puncturing a disc by an arbitrary number of smaller disjoint discs representing obstacles. The other spaces are obtained from this model by a suitable coordinate transformation that we show how to build. Our constructions exploit these coordinate transformations to adapt a navigation function on the model space to its more geometrically complicated (but topologically equivalent) instances. The formula that we present admits sphere-worlds of arbitrary dimension and is directly applicable to configuration spaces whose forbidden regions can be modeled by such generalized discs. We have implemented these navigation functions on planar scenarios, and simulation results are provided throughout the paper. {\textcopyright} 1992 IEEE},

@article{Carlisle2001,
abstract = {What attributes and settings of the Particle Swarm Optimizer constants result in a good, off-the-shelf, PSO implementation? There are many parameters, both explicit and implicit, associated with the Particle Swarm Optimizer that may affect its performance. There are the social and cognitive learning rates and magnitudes, the population size, the neighborhood size (including global neighborhoods), synchronous or asynchronous updates, and various additional controls, such as inertia and constriction factors. For any given problem, the values and choices for some of these parameters may have significant impact on the efficiency and reliability of the PSO, and yet varying other parameters may have little or no effect. What set of values, then, constitutes a good, general purpose PSO? While some of these factors have been investigated in the literature, others have not. In this paper we use existing literature and a selection of benchmark problems to determine a set of starting values suitable for an off the shelf PSO.},

abstract = {In differential drive robots, wheel slip severely affects the ability to track a desired motion trajectory and the problem is exacerbated when differential drive robots are used in applications involving coordination of multiple robots. This problem is investigated and, based on the wheel-ground traction forces, a simple slip avoidance control strategy is discussed. Differential drive robots with two driven wheels and one or more ball-type caster wheels are considered. The traction forces between the wheels and the ground surface are determined by assuming rigid wheel, rigid ground interaction. These traction forces are used to determine the maximum value of the input wheel torque that can be applied on the wheel before it slips. To avoid wheel slip, this limiting torque value is used to set a saturation limit for the input torque computed by a trajectory tracking controller. Stability of the closed-loop system with the slip avoidance strategy is shown. Experiments are conducted with this strategy using a single robot as well as multiple robots in a platoon. A representative sample of the experimental results is presented and discussed.},

The robot's reachable workspace is blocked by an obstacle that disconnects the free space formed when the ball and paddle remain in contact, forcing the machine to `let go' for a time to bring the ball to the desired state. The controller compositions we create guarantee that a ball introduced in the `safe workspace' remains there and is ultimately brought to the goal. We report on experimental results from an implementation of these formal composition methods, and present descriptive statistics characterizing the experiments.},
