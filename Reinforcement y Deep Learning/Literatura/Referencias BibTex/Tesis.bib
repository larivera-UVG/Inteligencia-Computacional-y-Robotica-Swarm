abstract = {The aggregate motion of a flock of birds, a herd of land animals, or a school of fish is a beautiful and familiar part of the natural world. But this type of complex motion is rarely seen in computer animation. This paper explores an approach based on simulation as an alternative to scripting the paths of each bird individually. The simulated flock is an elaboration of a particle system, with the simulated birds being the particles. The aggregate motion of the simulated flock is created by a distributed behavioral model much like that at work in a natural flock; the birds choose their own course. Each simulated bird is implemented as an independent actor that navigates according to its local perception of the dynamic environment, the laws of simulated physics that rule its motion, and a set of behaviors programmed into it by the "animator." The aggregate motion of the simulated flock is the result of the dense interaction of the relatively simple behaviors of the individual simulated birds.},

abstract = {We have employed a recent implementation of genetic algorithms to study a range of standard benchmark functions for global optimization. It turns out that some of them are not very useful as challenging test functions, since they neither allow for a discrimination between different variants of genetic operators nor exhibit a dimensionality scaling resembling that of real-world problems, for example that of global structure optimization of atomic and molecular clusters. The latter properties seem to be simulated better by two other types of benchmark functions. One type is designed to be deceptive, exemplified here by Lunacek's function. The other type offers additional advantages of markedly increased complexity and of broad tunability in search space characteristics. For the latter type, we use an implementation based on randomly distributed Gaussians. We advocate the use of the latter types of test functions for algorithm development and benchmarking.},

abstract = {In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the study of particle swarm optimization (PSO) in dynamic environments. This paper presents a new PSO model, called PSO with composite particles (PSO-CP), to address dynamic optimization problems. PSO-CP partitions the swarm into a set of composite particles based on their similarity using a "worst first" principle. Inspired by the composite particle phenomenon in physics, the elementary members in each composite particle interact via a velocity-anisotropic reflection scheme to integrate valuable information for effectively and rapidly finding the promising optima in the search space. Each composite particle maintains the diversity by a scattering operator. In addition, an integral movement strategy is introduced to promote the swarm diversity. Experiments on a typical dynamic test benchmark problem provide a guideline for setting the involved parameters and show that PSO-CP is efficient in comparison with several state-of-the-art PSO algorithms for dynamic optimization problems.},

abstract = {Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), an evolutionary algorithm for optimization is extended to determine if natural selection, or survival-of-the-fittest. can enhance the ability of the PSO algorithm to escape from local optima. To simulate selection, many simultaneous, parallel PSO algorithms, each one a swarm, operate on a test problem. Simple rules are developed to implement selection. The ability of this so-called Darwinian PSO to escape local optima is evaluated by comparing a single swarm and a similar set of swarms, differing primarily in the absence of the selection mechanism, operating on the same test problem. The selection process is shown to be capable of evolving the best type of particle velocity control, which is a problem specific design choice of the PSO algorithm.

abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems are one of the most rapidly developing, highest level and most practical applied unmanned aerial systems. Collision avoidance and trajectory planning are the core areas of any UAV system. However, there are theoretical and practical problems associated with the existing methods. To manage these problems, this paper presents an optimized artificial potential field (APF) algorithm for multi-UAV operation in 3-D dynamic space. The classic APF algorithm is restricted to single UAV trajectory planning and usually fails to guarantee the avoidance of collisions. To overcome this challenge, a method is proposed with a distance factor and jump strategy to solve common problems, such as unreachable targets, and ensure that the UAV will not collide with any obstacles. The method considers the UAV companions as dynamic obstacles to realize collaborative trajectory planning. Furthermore, the jitter problem is solved using the dynamic step adjustment method. Several resolution scenarios are illustrated. The method has been validated in quantitative test simulation models and satisfactory results were obtained in a simulated urban environment.},

In this paper, we show how to use the recently developed firefly algorithm to solve non-linear design problems.

In addition, we also propose a few new test functions with either singularity or stochastic components but with known global optimality and thus they can be used to validate new optimisation algorithms.

abstract = {Although recent progress in 2D mobile robot navigation has been significant, the great majority of existing work focuses only on ensuring that the robot reaches its goal. But to make autonomous navigation truly successful, the 'quality' of planned motion is important as well. Here, we develop and analyze a pose-following kinematic control law applicable to unicycle-type robots, such that the robot can generate intuitive, fast, smooth, and comfortable trajectories. The Lyapunov-based feedback control law is derived via singular perturbation. It is made up of three components: (i) egocentric polar coordinates with respect to an observer on the vehicle, (ii) a slow subsystem which describes the position of the vehicle, where the reference heading is obtained via state feedback, and (iii) a fast subsystem which describes the steering of the vehicle, where the vehicle heading is exponentially stabilized to the obtained reference heading. The resulting path is a smooth and intuitive curve, globally converging to an arbitrary target pose without singularities, from any given initial pose. Furthermore, we present a simple path following strategy based on the proposed control law to satisfy arbitrary velocity, acceleration and jerk bounds imposed by the user. Such requirements are important to any autonomous vehicle so as to avoid actuator overload and to make the path physically realizable, and they are critical for applications like autonomous wheelchairs where passengers can be physically fragile. {\textcopyright} 2011 IEEE.},

abstract = {The particle swarm is an algorithm for finding op- timal regions of complex search spaces through the interaction of individuals in a population ofparticles. Even though the algorithm, which is based on a metaphor of social interaction, has been shown to perform well, researchers have not adequately explained how it works. Further, traditional versions of the algorithm have had some undesirable dynamical properties, notably the particles' ve- locities needed to be limited in order to control their trajectories. The present paper analyzes a particle's trajectory as it moves in discrete time (the algebraic view), then progresses to the view of it in continuous time (the analytical view). A five-dimensional de- piction is developed, which describes the system completely. These analyses lead to a generalized model of the algorithm, containing a set of coefficients to control the system's convergence tendencies. Some results of the particle swarm optimizer, implementing modi- fications derived fromthe analysis, suggest methods for altering the original algorithm in ways that eliminate problems and increase the ability ofthe particle swarm to find optima ofsome well-studied test functions.},

abstract = {One of the most well-known bio-inspired algorithms used in optimization problems is the particle swarm optimization (PSO), which basically consists on a machine-learning technique loosely inspired by birds flocking in search of food. More specifically, it consists of a number of particles that collectively move on the search space in search of the global optimum. The Darwinian particle swarm optimization (DPSO) is an evolutionary algorithm that extends the PSO using natural selection, or survival of the fittest, to enhance the ability to escape from local optima. This paper firstly presents a survey on PSO algorithms mainly focusing on the DPSO. Afterward, a method for controlling the convergence rate of the DPSO using fractional calculus (FC) concepts is proposed. The fractional-order optimization algorithm, denoted as FO-DPSO, is tested using several well-known functions, and the relationship between the fractional-order velocity and the convergence of the algorithm is observed. Moreover, experimental results show that the FO-DPSO significantly outperforms the previously presented FO-PSO. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer-Verlag London Limited.},

The proposed MemPBPF algorithm uses a combination of the structure and rules of membrane computing. In that sense, the proposed MemPBPF algorithm contains dynamic membranes that include a pseudo-bacterial genetic algorithm for evolving the required parameters in the artificial potential field method. This hybridization between membrane computing, the pseudo-bacterial genetic algorithm, and the artificial potential field method provides an outperforming path planning algorithm for autonomous mobile robots. Computer simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MemPBPF algorithm in terms of path length considering collision avoidance and smoothness. Comparisons with two different versions employing a different number of elementary membranes and with other artificial potential field based algorithms are presented. The proposed MemPBPF algorithm yields improved performance in terms of time execution by using a parallel implementation on a multi-core computer. Therefore, the MemPBPF algorithm achieves high performance yielding competitive results for autonomous mobile robot navigation in complex and real scenarios.},

However, as one key issue in robot navigation, how to plan an optimal rescue path of a robot has not yet been fully solved. This paper studies robot path planning for multisurvivor rescue in limited survival time using a representative heuristic, particle swarm optimization (PSO). First, the robot path planning problem including multiple survivors is formulated as a discrete optimization one with high constraint, where the number of rescued persons is taken as the unique objective function, and the strength of a trapped person is used to constrain the feasibility of a path. Then, a new integer PSO algorithm is presented to solve the mathematical model, and several new operations, such as the update of a particle, the insertion and inversion operators, and the rapidly local search method, are incorporated into the proposed algorithm to improve its effectiveness. Finally, the simulation results demonstrate the capacity of our method in generating optimal paths with high quality.},

abstract = {Swarm intelligence, and swarm robotics in particular, are reaching a point where leveraging the potential of communication within an artificial system promises to uncover new and varied directions for interesting research without compromising the key properties of swarm-intelligent systems such as self-organization, scalability, and robustness. However, the physical constraints of using radios in a robotic swarm are hardly obvious, and the intuitive models often used for describing such systems do not always capture them with adequate accuracy. In order to demonstrate this effectively in the classroom, certain tools can be used, including simulation and real robots. Most instructors currently focus on simulation, as it requires significantly less investment of time, money, and maintenance-but to really understand the differences between simulation and reality, it is also necessary to work with the real platforms from time to time. To our knowledge, our course may be the only one in the world where individual students are consistently afforded the opportunity to work with a networked multi-robot system on a tabletop. The e-Puck, a low-cost small-scale mobile robotic platform designed for educational use, allows us bringing real robotic hardware into the classroom in numbers sufficient to demonstrate and teach swarm-robotic concepts. We present here a custom module for local radio communication as a stackable extension board for the e-Puck, enabling information exchange between robots and also with any other IEEE 802.15.4-compatible devices. Transmission power can be modified in software to yield effective communication ranges as small as fifteen centimeters.

Since its first publication in 1995 , it has been continually modified trying to improve its convergence properties . Thus , many variants have been proposed in the literature . Some of these variants were related to a particular problem and had little application outside the field where they have been proposed . Others have been used for solving different kind of problems and have enjoyed a longer life . These PSO variants have been used to solve a wide range of optimization and inverse problems : continuous , discrete , dynamical , multioptima , combinatorial , with and without additional constraints .

abstract = {What attributes and settings of the Particle Swarm Optimizer constants result in a good, off-the-shelf, PSO implementation? There are many parameters, both explicit and implicit, associated with the Particle Swarm Optimizer that may affect its performance. There are the social and cognitive learning rates and magnitudes, the population size, the neighborhood size (including global neighborhoods), synchronous or asynchronous updates, and various additional controls, such as inertia and constriction factors. For any given problem, the values and choices for some of these parameters may have significant impact on the efficiency and reliability of the PSO, and yet varying other parameters may have little or no effect. What set of values, then, constitutes a good, general purpose PSO? While some of these factors have been investigated in the literature, others have not. In this paper we use existing literature and a selection of benchmark problems to determine a set of starting values suitable for an off the shelf PSO.},

Collision avoidance, tradi- tionally considered a high level planning problem, can be effectively distributed between different levels of control, al- lowing real-time robot operations in a complex environment. This method has been extended to moving obstacles by using a time-varying artificial potential field. We have applied this obstacle avoidance scheme to robot arm mechanisms and have used a new approach to the general problem of real-time manipulator control. We reformulated the manipulator con- trol problem as direct control of manipulator motion in oper- ational space-the space in which the task is originally described-rather than as control of the task's corresponding joint space motion obtained only after geometric and kine- matic transformation. Outside the obstacles' regions of influ- ence, we caused the end effector to move in a straight line with an upper speed limit. The artificial potential field ap- proach has been extended to collision avoidance for all ma- nipulator links. In addition, ajoint space artificial potential field is used to satisfy the manipulator internal joint con- straints. This method has been implemented in the COSMOS system for a PUMA 560 robot. Real-time collision avoidance demonstrations on moving obstacles have been performed by using visual sensing. 1.},

The cooperation between robots requires multiple factors that need to be taken into consideration such as communication between agents, distributed control, power autonomy, cooperation, navigation strategy, locomotion, among others. This work focuses on navigation strategy with obstacles avoidance and victims localization. The strategy used for navigation is based on swarm theory where each robot is an swarm agent. The calculation of attraction and repulsion forces used to keep the swarm compact is used to avoid obstacles and attract the swarm to the victim zones. Additionally, an agent separation behavior is added, so the swarm can leave behind the agents, who found victims so these can support the victims by transmitting their location to a rescue team. Several experiments were performed to test navigation, obstacle avoidance and victims search. The results show how the swarm theory meets the requirements of navigation and search operations of cooperative robots.},

@article{Chowdhury2013,
abstract = {Engineering design problems often involve non-linear criterion functions, including inequality and equality constraints, and a mixture of discrete and continuous design variables. Optimization approaches entail substantial challenges when solving such an all-inclusive design problem. In this paper, a modification of the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm is presented, which can adequately address system constraints while dealing with mixed-discrete variables. Continuous search (particle motion), as in conventional PSO, is implemented as the primary search strategy; subsequently, the discrete variables are updated using a deterministic nearest-feasible-vertex criterion. This approach is expected to alleviate the undesirable difference in the rates of evolution of discrete and continuous variables. The premature stagnation of candidate solutions (particles) due to loss of diversity is known to be one of the primary drawbacks of the basic PSO dynamics. To address this issue in high dimensional design problems, a new adaptive diversity-preservation technique is developed. This technique characterizes the population diversity at each iteration. The estimated diversity measure is then used to apply (i) a dynamic repulsion away from the best global solution in the case of continuous variables, and (ii) a stochastic update of the discrete variables. For performance validation, the Mixed-Discrete PSO algorithm is applied to a wide variety of standard test problems: (i) a set of 9 unconstrained problems, and (ii) a comprehensive set of 98 Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) problems. We also explore the applicability of this algorithm to a large scale engineering design problem - -wind farm layout optimization. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

A potential function based on superquadrics is presented, which closely models a large class of object shapes. This potential function also prevents the creation of local minima when it is added to spherically symmetric attractive wells. Two compatible forms of the superquadric potential function are introduced: one for obstacle avoidance, and another for obstacle approach. The avoidance and approach potentials are implemented in simulations. In these simulations the end effector of the manipulator experiences an attractive force from a global spherical well, while the end effector and each of the links experience repulsive forces from all of the objects. The authors have also experimentally implemented the avoidance potentials on the CMU DDARM II. The results demonstrate successful obstacle avoidance and approach, and exhibit an improvement over existing potential schemes. {\textcopyright} 1990 IEEE},

They are characterized by a decentral- ized way of working that mimics the behavior of swarms of social insects, flocks of birds, or schools of fish. The advantage of these approaches over traditional tech- niques is their robustness and flexibility. These properties make swarm intelligence a successful design paradigm for algorithms that deal with increasingly complex problems. In this chapter we focus on two of the most successful examples of op- timization techniques inspired by swarm intelligence: ant colony optimization and particle swarm optimization. Ant colony optimization was introduced as a technique for combinatorial optimization in the early 1990s. The inspiring source of ant colony optimization is the foraging behavior of real ant colonies. In addition, particle swarm optimization was introduced for continuous optimization in the mid-1990s, inspired by bird flocking.},

abstract = {This paper presents a framework for decentralized control of self-organizing swarm systems based on the artificial potential functions (APFs). In this scheme, multiple agents in a swarm self-organize to flock and achieve formation control through attractive and repulsive forces among themselves using APFs. In particular, this paper presents a set of analytical guidelines for designing potential functions to avoid local minima for a number of representative scenarios. Specifically the following cases are addressed: 1) A non-reachable goal problem (a case that the potential of the goal is overwhelmed by the potential of an obstacle, 2) an obstacle collision problem (a case that the potential of the obstacle is overwhelmed by the potential of the goal), 3) an obstacle collision problem in swarm (a case that the potential of the obstacle is overwhelmed by potential of other robots in a group formation) and 4) an inter-robot collision problem (a case that the potential of the robot in a formation is overwhelmed by potential of the goal). The simulation results showed that the proposed scheme can effectively construct a self-organized swarm system with the capability of group formation, navigation and migration in the presence of obstacles. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2006.},

APF is a reactive approach since the trajectories are not planned explicitly but obtained while executing actions by differentiating a function what is called potential function. A potential function is differentiable real-valued function U : R m → R. The output of a potential function can be taken as the energy and it's negative gradient as the net-force acting on the robot. In this report, two different potential functions are presented; attractive-repulsive potential function, and navigation function. These two functions are tested in a simulation environment with various configurations. Experiments are done on the robocup small-size league robot soccer platform that I have been started developing with the first homework. At the end, we see that both methods have some limitations and innate problems.},

abstract = {We present a new methodology for exact robot motion planning and control that unifies the purely kinematic path planning problem with the lower level feedback controller design. Complete information about the freespace and goal is encoded in the form of a special artificial potential function—a navigation function—that connects the kinematic planning problem with the dynamic execution problem in a provably correct fashion. The navigation function automatically gives rise to a bounded-torque feedback controller for the robot's actuators that guarantees collision-free motion and convergence to the destination from almost all intial free configurations. Since navigation functions exist for any robot and obstacle course, our methodology is completely general in principle. However, this paper is mainly concerned with certain constructive techniques for a particular class of motion planning problems. Specifically, we present a formula for navigation functions that guide a point-mass robot in a generalized sphere world. The simplest member of this family is a space obtained by puncturing a disc by an arbitrary number of smaller disjoint discs representing obstacles. The other spaces are obtained from this model by a suitable coordinate transformation that we show how to build. Our constructions exploit these coordinate transformations to adapt a navigation function on the model space to its more geometrically complicated (but topologically equivalent) instances. The formula that we present admits sphere-worlds of arbitrary dimension and is directly applicable to configuration spaces whose forbidden regions can be modeled by such generalized discs. We have implemented these navigation functions on planar scenarios, and simulation results are provided throughout the paper. {\textcopyright} 1992 IEEE},

abstract = {Abstract Long-haul travel does not constitute an obstacle for tourists to travel and is fast gaining the attention of tourists in new and unique experiences. This study was conducted to identify the long-haul travel motivation by international tourists to Penang. A total of 400 respondents participated in this survey, conducted around the tourist attractions in Penang, using cluster random sampling. However, only 370 questionnaires were only used for this research. Data were analysed using SPSS software 22 version. The findings, ‘knowledge and novelty seeking' were the main push factors that drove long-haul travel by international tourists to Penang. Meanwhile, the main pull factor that attracts long- haul travel by international tourists to Penang was its ‘culture and history'. Additionally, there were partly direct and significant relationships between socio-demographic, trip characteristics and travel motivation (push factors and pull factors). Overall, this study identified the long-haul travel motivations by international tourists to Penang based on socio-demographic, trip characteristics and travel motivation and has indirectly helped in understanding the long-haul travel market particularly for Penang and Southeast Asia. This research also suggested for an effective marketing and promotion strategy in pro- viding useful information that is the key to attract international tourists to travel long distances.

Six most commonly used benchmarks are used to evaluate the MLDW strategies on the performance of PSOs. The results suggest that the PSO with W5 strategy is a good choice for solving unimodal problems due to its fast convergence speed, and the CLPSO with W5 strategy is more suitable for solving multimodal problems. Also, W5-CLPSO can be used as a robust algorithm because it is not sensitive to the complexity of problems for solving. {\textcopyright} 2009 IEEE.},

The controller compositions we create guarantee that a ball introduced in the `safe workspace' remains there and is ultimately brought to the goal.

This problem is investigated and, based on the wheel-ground traction forces, a simple slip avoidance control strategy is discussed. Differential drive robots with two driven wheels and one or more ball-type caster wheels are considered. The traction forces between the wheels and the ground surface are determined by assuming rigid wheel, rigid ground interaction. These traction forces are used to determine the maximum value of the input wheel torque that can be applied on the wheel before it slips. To avoid wheel slip, this limiting torque value is used to set a saturation limit for the input torque computed by a trajectory tracking controller. Stability of the closed-loop system with the slip avoidance strategy is shown. Experiments are conducted with this strategy using a single robot as well as multiple robots in a platoon. A representative sample of the experimental results is presented and discussed.},

abstract = {This paper describes the use of cubic splines for interpolating monotonic data sets. Interpolating cubic splines are popular for fitting data because they use low-order polynomials and have C2 continuity, a property that permits them to satisfy a desirable smoothness constraint. Unfortunately, that same constraint often violates another desirable property: monotonicity. It is possible for a set of monotonically increasing (or decreasing) data points to yield a curve that is not monotonic, i.e., the spline may oscillate. In such cases, it is necessary to sacrifice some smoothness in order to preserve monotonicity. The goal of this work is to determine the smoothest possible curve that passes through its control points while simultaneously satisfying the monotonicity constraint. We first describe a set of conditions that form the basis of the monotonic cubic spline interpolation algorithm presented in this paper. The conditions are simplified and consolidated to yield a fast method for determining monotonicity. This result is applied within an energy minimization framework to yield linear and nonlinear optimization-based methods. We consider various energy measures for the optimization objective functions. Comparisons among the different techniques are given, and superior monotonic C2 cubic spline interpolation results are presented. Extensions to shape preserving splines and data smoothing are described. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},
